---Table extensions

---Returns a table with preallocated memory
---
---Returns an empty table with more memory allocated.
---This lets you microoptimize cases where a table receives
---a lot of elements and you know the number beforehand,
---such as one for each UnitDef, by avoiding reallocation.

---@param nArray number hint for count of array elements
---@param nHashed number hint for count of hashtable elements
---@return table
function table.new(nArray, nHashed) end
