// StateChg.h -- Generic State Change support for units that activate and deactivate or whatever

// Due to limitiations of the scripting language, this file must be included twice.  The

// where the functions are defined (and of course before they are called.)

// The Following macros must be defined:  ACTIVATECMD and DEACTIVATECMD.  They are the commands
// to run when the units is actiavted or deactivated.
