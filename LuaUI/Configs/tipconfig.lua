	"Use the priority buttons to maximize your efficiency during stalls (expenditure outstripping income). Resources will be allocated to high priority units before low priority ones.",
	"Repairing units is twice as fast as building them, but proceeds at 1/4th the normal speed if the unit has been recently damaged.",
	"Different AA types are effective against different targets. The Hacksaw missile turret is lethal against bombers, while the Thresher flak cannon cuts down gunships well.",
	"When fighting AoE weapons, spread out your units to minimize damage.",
	"You can draw on the map with tilde (~) and left mouse. ~ + double click adds a labelled point, while ~ + middle click adds a point without label. ~ + right click erases.",
	"Many commands can be issued over a whole area by keeping button the down and dragging a box or disc.",
	
	"Heavy striders are built by the Strider Hub, buildable by any standard constructor.",
	"Riot units double as improvised anti-air against most gunships.",
	"Nuclear missiles are devastating, but can be intercepted by antinuke systems which provide coverage over a wide area.",
	"Cloaked units can be revealed by close contact, or when damaged.",
	"Slow-rays and other weapons with slowing effects will reduce the target's movement and firing rate by up to 50%.",
	"Hovercraft are fast and can transverse water, but struggle on even gentle slopes.",
	"Most units have a smart Unit AI, which has them automatically kite or jink enemy units as needed on a fight order or when standing still.",
	"Spiders have excellent mobility including the ability to scale cliffs, although they tend to lack direct strength.",
	"Space-clicking on a unit or its build button in the menu brings up the \255\255\64\0Context Menu\008, where you can view unit data or access marketplace functions.",
