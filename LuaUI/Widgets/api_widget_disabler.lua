--[[Documentation:
The table below here controls what widgets are disabled. To add new widgets to it, simply add the line [2] = "widget human name"
(NOT the file name! It's the string in the name field of the widget!).
When the widget is loaded, it sees if widgets included in the table are loaded, and disables them if they are.
The widget then, if necessary, waits to deliver a list of disabled widgets to users.
After this is completed, the widget removes itself.
Please also include the reason in the table itself under the key 'reason'.
If the type of widget you want to disable is a user made widget, be sure to make the type 'user' so a message is generated for the user.
Otherwise, make type equal to 'map' to put the reason in the infolog instead.]]
