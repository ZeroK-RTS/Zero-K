-- Standalone win counter designed to be used through WG.
-- This will increment winner scores on game end on a per-player basis, and preserve them from game to game if the player's retain their allies. 
-- The actual allyTeam and player ids don't matter, just the player groups.
-- If players on the same allyTeam are on different teams (i.e. all controlling the same units) between games, the scores will still be preserved,
-- as the players in question are still working on the same side between games.
