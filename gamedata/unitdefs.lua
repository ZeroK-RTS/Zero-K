--[[ This would ideally be 'gamedata/unitdefs_post.lua' because that is
     the convention used in the past, back when map files overrode games'
     by default. Also it would be elegant if mappers could just copy our
     gameside file and get something working. However, there are issues
     preventing this from happening:

     1) VFS.FileExists is (as of 104-1435) broken and seems to behave as
        if the namespace argument was (VFS.BASE .. VFS.GAME .. VFS.MAP)
	 regardless of what it actually is. This would make us include the
	 file every time since it's present gameside. It could be worked
	 around by using pcall and ignoring an inclusion failure, but...

     2) VFS.Include is broken in the same way on old engines (specifically
        on 104-287 which we want to keep supporting for the time being).
	 This means that the gameside posts would instead be included twice. ]]
