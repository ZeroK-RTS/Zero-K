--List of stuff in this gadget (to help us remember stuff for future debugging/improvement):

--Main logic:
--1) Periodic(CheckAFK & Ping) ---> mark player as AFK/Lagging --->  Check if player has Shared Command --> Check for Candidate with highest ELO -- > Loop(send unit away to candidate & remember unit Ownership).
--2) Periodic(CheckAFK & Ping) ---> IF AFK/Lagger is no longer lagging --> Return all units & delete unit Ownership.

--Other logics:
--1) If Owner's builder (constructor) created a unit --> Owner inherit the ownership to that unit
--2) If Taker finished an Owner's unit --> the unit belong to Taker
--3) wait 3 strike (3 time AFK & Ping) before --> mark player as AFK/Lagging
