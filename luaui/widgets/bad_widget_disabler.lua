--[[Documentation:
The table below here controls what widgets are disabled. To add new widgets to it, simply add the line [2] = "widget human name"
(NOT the file name! It's the string in the name field of the widget!).

When the widget is loaded, it sees if widgets included in the table are loaded, and disables them if they are.
After this is completed, the widget removes itself.

Please also include the reason in the reason table.]]
